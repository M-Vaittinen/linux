description: |
  BD71828GW is a single-chip power management IC for battery-powered portable
  devices. The IC integrates 7 buck converters, 7 LDOs, and a 1500 mA
  single-cell linear charger. Also included is a Coulomb counter, a real-time
  clock (RTC), and a 32.768 kHz clock gate.

  The BD71828 RUN state is divided into 4 configurable run-levels named RUN0,
  RUN1, RUN2 and RUN3. Bucks 1, 2, 6 and 7 can be either controlled individually
  via I2C, or some/all of them can be bound to run-levels and controlled as a
  group. If bucks are controlled individually these run-levels are ignored. See
  ../regulator/rohm,bd71828-regulator.yaml for how to define regulator voltages
  for run-levels. Run-levels can be changed by I2C or GPIO depending on PMIC's
  OTP configuration.

    description: |
      BD71827 and BD71828 have SAR ADC for measuring charging currents.
      External sense resistor (RSENSE in data sheet) should be used. If some
      other but 30MOhm resistor is used the resistance value should be given
      here in Ohms.

      (See run-level control in data-sheet). If this property is omitted but
      some bucks are marked to be controlled by run-levels - then OTP option
      allowing run-level control via I2C is assumed.

  gpio-reserved-ranges:
    description: |
      Usage of BD71828 GPIO pins can be changed via OTP. This property can be
      used to mark the pins which should not be configured for GPIO. Please see
      the ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.
