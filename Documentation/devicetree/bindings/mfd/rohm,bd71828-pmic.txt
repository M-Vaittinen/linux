* ROHM BD71828 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

BD71828GW is a single-chip power management IC for battery-powered portable
devices. The IC integrates 7 buck converters, 7 LDOs, and a 1500 mA single-cell
linear charger. Also included is a Coulomb counter, a real-time clock (RTC),
and a 32.768 kHz clock gate.

Required properties:
 - compatible			: Should be "rohm,bd71828".
 - reg				: I2C slave address.
 - interrupt-parent		: Phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts			: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - clocks			: The parent clock connected to PMIC.
 - #clock-cells			: Should be 0.
 - regulators			: List of child nodes that specify the
				  regulators. Please see
				  ../regulator/rohm,bd71828-regulator.txt
 - gpio-controller		: To indicate BD71828 acts as a GPIO controller.
 - #gpio-cells			: Should be 2. The first cell is the pin number
				  and the second cell is used to specify flags.
				  See ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.

The BD71828 RUN state is divided into 4 configurable run-levels named RUN0,
RUN1, RUN2 and RUN3. Bucks 1, 2, 6 and 7 can be either controlled individually
via I2C, or some/all of them can be bound to run-levels and controlled as a
group. If bucks are controlled individually these run-levels are ignored. See
../regulator/rohm,bd71828-regulator.txt for how to define regulator voltages
for run-levels. Run-levels can be changed by I2C or GPIO depending on PMIC's OTP
configuration.

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names		: Should contain name for output clock.
- rohm,dvs-runlvl-bucks 	: array of 32bit values indicating bucks that
				  are controlled by run-levels. <1> for buck1,
				  <2> for buck2, ... Only bucks 1, 2, 6 and 7
				  can be controlled by run-levels
- rohm,dvs-vsel-gpios		: GPIOs used to control PMIC run-levels. Should
				  describe two GPIOs. (See run-level control in
				  data-sheet). If this property is omitted but
				  some bucks are marked to be controlled by
				  run-levels - then OTP option allowing
				  run-level control via I2C is assumed.
- rohm,lid-open-high		: HALL sensor used to detect the LID position
				  can be connected to the PMIC HALL_INPUT pin.
				  Default is that LID is open when HALL_INPUT
				  is LOW. This property can be used to invert
				  this logic.
- gpio-reserved-ranges		: Usage of GPIO pins can be changed via OTP.
				  This property can be used to mark the pins
				  which should not be configured for GPIO.
				  Please see the ../gpio/gpio.txt for more
				  information.
