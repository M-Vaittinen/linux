  This module is part of the ROHM BD96811 MFD device. For more details
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd96811-pmic.yaml.

  The regulator controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
  on the device tree.

  The valid names for BD96811 regulator nodes are
  vout1, vout2, ..., vout5.

          The BD96811 may have dfifferent types of regulator regulators
          depending on OTP option. Indicate type of regulator by assigning
          the type to 1 (BUCK), 2 (BOOST) or 3 (LDO) to match your PMIC.

          configured by OTP. Provide limit matching OTP on the IC as
          offset from the target output voltage.
