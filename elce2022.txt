ELCE 2022 – Journey.

This is a tale of my trip to Embedded Linux Europe conference at year 2022. My employer ROHM Semiconductor was kind enough to pay my participation fee, hotel and the flights - the value of open source is well understood by my manager. I want to thank ROHM for providing me with this opportunity to collaborate.

Before the flight I was nervous. I always am. I am nervous of traveling and nervous of meeting new people. I was pretty damn sure I would be late from the flight. I was also pretty damn sure I would be uninteresting attendant who has done nothing important when compared to other participants. I felt like some wannabe developer who is trying to join the circles he does not belong. It does not matter I have been working in the field for 17 years – solving problems and developing device drivers as well as features to frameworks. I’ve been estimating efforts and planned how existing mechanisms could be supported by the platform when new hardware generation is built. I have patches in-tree. I review and I discuss. I am right at times and I am wrong at other days. My brains tell I am just as anyone. Still, for some reason I always feel that others do so much more and know things so much better.



Partially this can be because I easily compare myself to people that are better than me in a specific area. When I look what I know of PMIC hardware, I compare myself to the hardware designers in my company. They’re superior to me on their area. When I think what I know of Linux kernel regulators, I compare myself to Mark Brown. Gpio – Linus W. MFD – Lee jones. Patch statistics – someone who is higher than me… I always see ones who are better than me. It’s kind of that I don’t feel I am good – if I am not the best. And yes, I realize how ridiculous it is – but I can’t help feeling I should be better.

Anyways, my flight was scheduled to leave Monday morning around 6 AM – and the website of Finavia maintaining the Oulu airport stated one should be there 2 hours prior the take-off. I decided that leaving at home 2 hrs prior the take-off should suffice. Whole Sunday I spent wondering if I had packed everything I would need. I finally pre-ordered a taxi to be at my home around 4 AM (which already was an achievement as I hate making phone calls to unknown people) and at the evening I set my phone to wake me up at 3.30 AM... That was really not needed.

Yep – I don’t think I did sleep too much at that night. When the phone rang I was already awake. Made cup of coffee and a little later I was sitting in the taxi. Luckily the driver started the discussion so I didn’t have to oush myself to start talking. And after a while I had a nice chatter with the driver. Considering how hard it is for me to start discussing with people, it is strange how much I enjoy talking with people. It’s like I am afraid to death of something I usually quite enjoy.

One might ask why on earth someone who has such big difficulties in talking to strangers goes to a conference? What was my motivation, huh?

I guess some may consider me “a bit” odd when I reveal that it is meeting the people. Right. The main motivation for me to visit the ELCE at 2022 was meeting the people I have never met before. It’s as I said before – I am really terrified of opening a discussion, horrified of making myself known. And one of the biggest fears is that I make some mistake and others will think I am not too clever… Still – after I manage to push myself over that limit – I do usually enjoy speaking with people. I like learning what others are like, their habits, likings and dislikings. Sure thing I also wanted to listen some of the techy talks – I have a passion for learning more and often these talks contain at least some bits of information I have lacked.

So … We can fast-forward to the Dublin. At the Monday I had no real talks to attend as I noticed the Monday talks did all require pre-registration. I still decided to walk to the conference place just so I knew where to be at the Monday morning. I scouted the place and was returning back to the hotel when I saw familiar looking faces at the traffic-lights. It was pretty sure it was Geert who I had earlier seen presenting in some virtual conferences. Geert also happens to be the person I had chatted most frequently in the IRC. Person who had always been nice and helpful.

I really collected all of my courage and was able to spill out “Sorry, but do I know you. Are you Geert?”. Oh, little did I know of how wrong I pronounced his name :) It was only later (maybe Wednesday) when Marek explained me how Geert is pronounced ;) Anyways, Geert admitted it was him and recognized my name when I introduced myself. I was asking of his plans and whether he planned to attend any sessions Today. I did also ask if he had plans for all the evenings, hoping that perhaps we could have a pint together and do some chatting.

Unfortunately Geert was pretty busy – he was presenting his talk about fbdev => DRM conversion and there were special evening occasions for presenters. I felt a little bit stupid – how didn’t I think that in advance. It was quite rude to try to push myself into his company, right? I did back of thinking I’d better leave Geert alone, he probably was going to be busy – I didn’t want to hold him longer…

Well, after this occasion I was still quite delighted I had met Geert in person. Finally. I had had so many chatters with him in IRC – and even if we had never really worked on the exactly same corner of kernel, he had still always helped me when I had asked questions.

I went back to my hotel, took a quick nap just to somehow recover from the horrible night – and then started to work with the KX022A accelerometer driver. I had carried the sensor + a beaglebone black with me. I tend to lose the sense of time when I start working with code. Same happened to me now. Suddenly I realized it was almost 8PM – it was time to think what to eat. At that moment I noticed Geert had messaged me in IRC, asking me to have a dinner with him and Marek. Unfortunately I hadn’t noticed the invitation so I missed the dinner and chatter. It was really a bummer – still, it kind of made my day. I had been invited to have a dinner with two experienced kernel developers. (Yet, the small voice in my head was telling that maybe it was just because Geert felt a pity for me – poor sod who was all alone in the conference).

The next morning I headed to a “first timer breakfast” – event. When I arrived to the fourth floor, all of the tables were pretty crowded and people were chatting together. There seemed to be no familiar names in the badges. I took a cup of coffee and walked through the room. More I looked the people discussing in the tables, less I felt like getting there interrupting. It looked like each table consisted of a group of people who knew each-others. Jumping in would’ve felt like intruding. I end up just quickly drinking my coffee and then quietly leaving the breakfast..

Some of the Tuesday morning I spent just walking around the conference area trying to spot familiar names. I hoped to meet people I had been interacting with before. That is mostly the Linux device-driver / subsystem folks from areas like regulators/regmap, GPIO, RTC, WDG, CLK, power-supply, IIO, V4L2 – as those are the areas I have been working with. This was pretty hard – the OSS event covered quite a few areas of open source, so kernel/driver folks were in minority – especially for the Tuesday when ELCE was not yet propertly started and most of the talks concentrated on other topics. I did attend some talks about booting, tracing and debugging. I managed to have a nice chatter with a fellow Finnish attendee working at Veikkaus, and I also had a nice chatter with Geert who happened again to be walking to same direction with me. It was also nice to see Kieran who was rushing to lunch recognized me as he was passing by.

The most puzzling part of Tuesday for me was the evening event in the Guinnes store house. Schedule had it titled as “all attendee Party” – but the OSS website stated that attending required some special registration and paying registration fee. To me this was pretty contradicting and I was pretty sure this event was not open for me. It was a pity as that would have been the perfect place for meeting the people. Well, as perfect as it can get with the OSS format where we have such a large amount of attendees with so wide variety of field of interest. I did some coding at the hotel and decided I might just as well walk to the Guinnes store house to see what was going on there. I packed my badge and a hoodie in my backpack and walked to the place. When I arrived there maybe half an hour after the event had started, I saw large group of people swarming on the doors. It seemed as if there was a lengthy queue… I really didn’t feel like staying in the queue for who knows how long just to being told that I was not allowed in – thus I just turned around and walked back to the hotel. Big disappointment.

The Wednesday had much more topics targeted to the Embedded Linux. I did attend to some of the keynotes sessions. This was pretty much the only part of the conference I did not really enjoy. I won’t go into details but for me there was just too much BS covered with sugar and syrup. Yeah, I understand that companies are making things possible by funding – and I am grateful for that. I also do understand companies want something back from their investments – othervice the investment would be just a donation. Still, when grown up people are patting each others backs on the stage smiling and saying nothing concrete… Okay, enough of this. I am sure there were target audience for the keynotes as well it’s just that I was not really capable of digesting it. Maybe it is just my fault :)

I did definitely Enjoy Josef’s show about booting a processor. Maybe not such a technical deep-dive (although I am sure Joseph could also go into the technical details), but Joseph is just tremendously skilled speaker. I definitely suggest you to go see him live if you haven’t. I wish I had even 1% of that confidence – being able to interact with people like that would probably change my conference experiences for good :)

One of the talks I was really excited to see was about I2C in Linux by Luca Ceresoli. I had exhanged a few emails with Luca regarding modelling an I2C address translation feature in Linux kernel – Luca had done excellent patch set tackling this issue and I had used his work in a video SerDes driver I was drafting. After the talk I gathered all of my courage and nervously went to talk with Luca. It was actually a nice experience, I enjoyed quite much meeting him :) I just hope I didn’t seem arrogant when I discussed with him about his presentation. I really liked it and I am sure it helped many developers who are getting familiar with the Linux I2C devices. If you need to write your first Linux driver for an I2C device – go see his talk.

I was on a verge of asking Luca if he would like to have a pint later – but my inner “I may not be worthy” voice kicked in and told me that Luca probably has more important meetings arranged already. This same voice prevented me from suggesting this to other people like Alexandre Belloni (who remembered me from a private email – which was surprizing to me) or Krzyzstof Kozlowski who I have also had some private discussions in the past. By the way, listening the talk by Krzyzstof about DT bindings probably helped me to avoid one re-iteration of my dt-binding patch for the Kionix KX022A accelerometer driver which I am writing. I was wrong and asked him a question. I felt a bit stupid as the answer was so obvious and I should’ve thought of it – but in the end of the day, I learned.

Later at the evening when I was at hotel I did some messaging with my wife. She told me that I am a bit silly – I should not try to be a fortune teller who can predict the contents of the calendars. She told me that I should allow others to reply on their own behalf. Yep. I do have a wise wife :)

So, during the Thursday I agreed with  Krzyzstof to go and have a pint together at Friday. I also contacted Laurent who was participating the plumbers in Dublin, and we planned to go and have a coffee. It turned out the coffee was replaced by a quick chatter at the front door of the conference hall due to the scheduling issues – but I still managed to say “Hello” to him as well.

As the conference went on I get slowly my diesel started. It became easier for me to have a chat with people – although it still wasn’t exactly easy. I met shortly with Marek Vasut and had a short discussion about bd71837 clock gating problem with I.MX8. I managed to say “Hello” to Stephen Boyd and also shortly chatted with Drew about using the beaglebones in driver development. The “climax of socializing” for me was having a pint and burger with Krzyzstof after the always so fun Tim Bird’s “closing game” was held. Talking with Krzyzstof was easy and cool. We really just chatted and had our dinner. It was nice covering topics like motorbikes and politics, technology and agriculture with him.

All in all, the week was successful yet tiring. It was great getting back home after staying awake the night (again) waiting for my flight to start…

So, I am waiting for the next time already, and really wondering if I should challenge my fear of social encounters and submit a talk proposal for the next time. I have been giving out some Linux training back when I worked at Nokia – and every time I did that I was horrified. Yet, it is somehow cool to see that I do survive from such extreme situations.

Now it is time for me to go to the wilderness in the northern Finland. Walk through the swamps and forests to sleeping under tarpaulin somewhere close to 10 kilometers away from the nearest road. There I can load my batteries for the next set of social encounters ;)
